# discretize-docs

A place where we automatically deploy the discretize documentation.

This repository is automatically edited by our army of robots on the
Travis CI service. Changes to the documentation should not be made
here but rather in the [`discretize`](https://github.com/simpeg/discretize)
repository.

If you would like to set up domain forwarding manually here, that's
totally okay - check out the `index.html` file at the top-level of
this repository for an example.

If you have any questions about this repository, feel free to ping
[@banesullivan](https://github.com/banesullivan) as he originally 
implemented this hosting service for the discretize documentation.
