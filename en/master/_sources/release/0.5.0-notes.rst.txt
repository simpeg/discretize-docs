===================================
``discretize`` 0.5.0 Release Notes
===================================

This minor release has a few small bug fixes as well as a new volume averaging
operator.

The Volume Averaging operator has been implemented for arbitrary `TensorMesh`,
`TreeMesh`, and combinations of them. It is defined as being a mass conserving
operation. More details can be found in its documentation, :func:`discretize.utils.volume_average`.

There are also some updates for the new deprecations in ``matplotlib`` to hopefully
throw less deprecation warnings internally. There are still a few left which are
on our radar to fix in the next patch.

We are also dropping support for python 3.5 which will reach end-of-life within
a few weeks.
