===================================
``discretize`` 0.4.12 Release Notes
===================================

This patch release is for a few small bugs and code speed improvements.

There is now a fast function for return active cell indexes for ``TensorMesh``-s,
``TreeMesh``-s, and symmetric ``CylMesh``-s below a topography surface defined by
scattered points, ``discretize.utils.active_from_xyz``.

There is also a bug fix of `#197 <https://github.com/simpeg/discretize/issues/197>`__
for the ``discretize.utils.refine_tree_xyz`` helper function on QuadTree meshes
when attempting to extend the padding vertically using ``method=surface``.

We have update links as we are now using discourse over google groups as a means
for users to ask for general help.
