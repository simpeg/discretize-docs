``discretize`` 0.6.2 Release Notes
===================================

This patch release changes ``FutureWarning`` to ``DeprecationWarning`` to temporarily
hide them from end users. Our current plan is to switch them back to ``FutureWarning`` on
the next minor release. We encourage developers to update their code prior to this.
