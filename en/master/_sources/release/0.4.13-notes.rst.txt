``discretize`` 0.4.13 Release Notes
===================================

This release contains some bug fixes:

First, we have squashed a few bugs related to serializing the TreeMesh to a json
object. ``tree_mesh.save`` should now work. We have also added the ability to
write out a 2D ``TreeMesh`` to a UBC-GIF-like format. There is no official QuadTree
mesh from UBC-GIF however, so this just mimics the 3D format for a 2D mesh.
