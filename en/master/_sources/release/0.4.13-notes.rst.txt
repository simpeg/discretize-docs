``discretize`` 0.4.13 Release Notes
===================================

This release contains some bug fixes:

First, we have squashed a few bugs related to serializing the TreeMesh to a json
object. ``tree_mesh.save`` should now work. We have also added the ability to
write out a 2D ``TreeMesh`` to a UBC-GIF-like format. There is no official QuadTree
mesh from UBC-GIF however, so this just mimics the 3D format for a 2D mesh.

There was also a small bug in reading in a 2D UBC TensorMesh model when the values
were split over multiple lines. We have altered the logic here so as to be
independant of the structure of that file, as the values should always appear in a
specific order.
