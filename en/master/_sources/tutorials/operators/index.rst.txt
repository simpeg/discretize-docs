Operators
=========

Numerical solutions to differential equations using the finite volume
method require discrete operators. These include averaging operators
and differential operators. Averaging operators are used when a
variable living on some part of the mesh (e.g. nodes, centers, edges or
faces) must be approximated at other locations. Differential operators
include the gradient, divergence, curl and scalar Laplacian.

The discrete operators are properties of each mesh class (*tensor mesh*,
*tree mesh*, *curvilinear mesh*). An operator is only constructed when
called. Since each mesh type has a similar API, the operators can be
called using the same syntax.

To learn about discrete operators, we have provided a set
of tutorials. These tutorials aim to teach the user:

	- how to construct averaging and differential operators from a mesh
	- how to apply the discrete operators to discrete variables
	- how to impose boundary conditions using differential operators
	- how discrete differential operators preserve vector calculus identities
