Averaging Matricies
===================

Averaging matricies are used when a discrete variable living on some part of
the mesh (e.g. nodes, centers, edges or faces) must be approximated at other
locations. Averaging matricies are sparse and exist for 1D, 2D and
3D meshes. For each mesh class (*Tensor mesh*, *Tree mesh*,
*Curvilinear mesh*), the set of averaging matricies are properties that are
only constructed when called.

Here we discuss:

    - How to construct and apply averaging matricies
    - Averaging matricies in 1D, 2D and 3D
    - Averaging discontinuous functions
    - The transpose of an averaging matrix

# We then compute the scalar function at cell centers to validate the

# 1D, 2D and 3D Averaging

# average between nodes, cell centers, faces and edges. For this example we
# describe the averaging operator from faces to cell centers in 1D, 2D and 3D.

# Discontinuous Functions and the Transpose
# -----------------------------------------
#
# Here we show the effects of applying averaging operators to discontinuous
# functions. We will see that averaging smears the function at
# discontinuities.
#
# The transpose of an averaging operator is also an
# averaging operator. For example, we can average from cell centers to faces
# by taking the transpose of operator that averages from faces to cell centers.
# Note that values on the boundaries are not accurate when applying the
# transpose as an averaging operator. This is also true for staggered grids.
#

# Create mesh and obtain averaging operators

# Create a variable on cell centers

xy = mesh.gridCC
v[(xy[:, 1] > 0)] = 0.
v[(xy[:, 1] < -10.) & (xy[:, 0] > -10.) & (xy[:, 0] < 10.)] = 50.
