``discretize`` 0.7.3 Release Notes
===================================

February 28, 2022

This patch release fixes a few minor bugs related to the edge curl operator in 2D for
```TensorMesh`` which was not properly indexed as edges. There is also minor additions
to the functionality of cylindrical meshes, allowing the user to set an origin point
for the rotational component. Finally, there is an added dot product test to simplify
future development and testing.
