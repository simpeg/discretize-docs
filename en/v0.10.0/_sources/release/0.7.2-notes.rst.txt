``discretize`` 0.7.2 Release Notes
===================================

December 6, 2021

This patch release is for a minor improvements to a few functions

Searching
---------
The function ``closest_points_index`` now exists on the `base.BaseMesh`, with a default
implementation based on a KDTree lookup. This allows for much faster repeated calls.
The previous function one off function will now point to this method on the mesh.

Negative Levels
---------------
To referring to levels on ``TreeMesh`` refine functions, you can now pass negative
integers to refer to the maximum refine level (similar to negative indexing on arrays)
