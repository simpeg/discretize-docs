``discretize`` 0.7.4 Release Notes
===================================

This bug fix patch addressed an issue accessing the face indices of a ``TreeCell``.
We are also testing a new versioning system that is based off of git tags. If you are
a developer ``setuptools_scm`` is now a requirement along with an installation of
``git`` that is discoverable from the command line.
