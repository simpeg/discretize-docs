``discretize`` 0.6.3 Release Notes
===================================

This patch contains a bug-fix related to plotting on a :class:`TreeMesh`.
It also contains a few additions which caused a minor functionality change in
:func:`utils.refine_tree_xyz`.

The first convenience is the addition of a `slice_loc` parameter to the
:func:`mixins.mpl_mod.InterfaceMPL.plot_slice`. This allows for slightly more
intuitive use over the old `ind` keyword, by allowing the user to directly specify the
location parameter of the slice.

The second addition, which caused the minor functionality change in `refine_tree_xyz`,
is the addition of two specialized refine functions for the `TreeMesh`. We can now directly
refine all cells that intersect a box (or list of boxes) with :func:`TreeMesh.refine_box`,
and similarly we can refine all cells that intersect a ball (or list of balls) with
:func:`TreeMesh.refine_ball`.
